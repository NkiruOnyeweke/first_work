# first_work
happens to be my first project on my journey towards becoming a data scientist. Coming from a background (linguistics), which has no form of relationship with this field, it's kind of a struggle grasping. So, I've decided to document even my tiniest projects, code or not.
This project contains SQL commands, using MYSQL to create tables and insert values into these tables. Also, it contains commands that returns specific values, forming joins and unions and so on.
I went further to visualize this same dataset on Tableau, creating a clearer understanding of the table. The link will be available soonest.
YES! this isn't some coding script where i create the dopest program (hopefully, in no distant time, I'll be doing just that), however for me, at my present level, i couldn't be more proud of my little tables.
Please feel free to commend, correct and criticize. Thanks :)
